# 🦀 Rust → C# Developer Handbook

Welcome to the **Rust to C# Developer Handbook** — a practical, example-driven reference for translating low-level and systems-focused Rust code into modern, idiomatic **C#** using .NET 8+.

Whether you're:
- Porting an unsafe binary parser,
- Wrapping native Rust libraries for .NET interop,
- Learning Rust from a C# perspective,
- Or building fast, safe CLI tools in either language —

This guide is designed to make the transition smooth, structured, and insightful.

## 🧭 What's Inside

The handbook is organized into grouped sections for fast navigation:

### 🧱 Language & Syntax
Understand variables, types, control flow, and pattern matching.

### 🧩 Types & Traits
Map Rust `struct`s and `trait`s to C# `class`es and `interface`s, including generics and inheritance.

### ⚙️ Memory & Runtime
Ownership, error handling, nullability, collections, and working with serialized data.

### 🚀 Async & Concurrency
Translate async/await, background tasks, and shared-state concurrency between ecosystems.

### 🔧 Tooling & Build
Compare Cargo and .NET CLI, setup CI/CD pipelines, use analyzers and source generators.

### 🔢 Binary File Parsing
Read and write binary formats with idiomatic, safe code — in both Rust and C#.

### 🧪 Testing & Advanced
Write unit tests, run benchmarks, and apply low-level performance tricks.

## 🧠 How It Works

Every section includes:
- 🔄 **Side-by-side syntax comparisons**
- 🧪 **Real-world examples** in Rust and C#
- 🧠 **Conceptual mappings** of language features
- 📝 **Edge-case notes** for memory safety, null handling, trait behavior, etc.

---

## 👩‍💻 Who It's For

- **Rust devs** building GUI tools, web apps, or interop layers in C#
- **C# devs** learning safe systems-level programming with Rust
- **Teams** migrating code, porting CLI utilities, or writing cross-platform libraries

---

## ✨ Goals

- Eliminate confusion with a clean, consistent reference format
- Help you write idiomatic, production-quality C# or Rust by example
- Make porting between the two ecosystems approachable — and fun
